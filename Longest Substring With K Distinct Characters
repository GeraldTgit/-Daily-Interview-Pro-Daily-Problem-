#I've been trying to solve this Python quiz for the past  hours. I get tired and came across Open Chat AI GPT. I send the question to them and they solve it within seconds

#You are given a string s, and an integer k. Return the length of the longest substring in s that contains at most k distinct characters.

#For instance, given the string:

#aabcdefff and k = 3, then the longest substring with 3 distinct characters would be defff. The answer should be 5.

def longest_substring_with_k_distinct_characters(s, k):

  max_length = 0

  start = 0

  end = 0

  char_count = {}



  while end < len(s):

    char = s[end]

    if char in char_count:

      char_count[char] += 1

    else:

      char_count[char] = 1

    end += 1



    while len(char_count) > k:

      char = s[start]

      char_count[char] -= 1

      if char_count[char] == 0:

        del char_count[char]

      start += 1



    max_length = max(max_length, end - start)



  return max_length



   
print(longest_substring_with_k_distinct_characters('aabcdefffghi', 3))

# 5 (because 'defff' has length 5 with 3 characters)
